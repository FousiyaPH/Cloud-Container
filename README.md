Docker is one of software that support creating containerized software packages for deployment and running inside host system. Docker takes only few memories as compared with virtual machine and has high performance. The application and its dependencies will be contained inside container and that will make application more stable in different environments. Even if Host system has different version of supporting components, the application inside container can use dependencies which is already inside container and that will make more isolation for application to the outside world.

Docker software can be downloaded from https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows

Docker allows user to use Linux or windows containers and Linux is more light weight. 

Docker container command will list all running containers in host system. In docker, images and containers are two major terms used. If user can think in terms of Object-oriented system, Image is a class and container is object. User will first download base images from Docker Hub which is huge repository that contains public images. 

Using docker, user can download image from docker hub and then create container out of it. The container can be start/stop from host machine. 

All the script files and read me instructions can be found inside folders.
